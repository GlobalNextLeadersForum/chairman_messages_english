            <div class="main-title">Greetings</div>
            <div class="charman-messages">
                <div class="text">We always appreciate your continued support for Global Next Leaders Forum (GNLF).</div>
                <div class="text">With the aim of developing global leaders for the next generation, we have been holding the forums where students and professors from around the world gather to discuss current international issues from various perspectives. And this year, in 2021, we held the 10th conference. Your cooperation makes it possible for us to carry out these activities. On behalf of all the members, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.</div>
                <div class="text">Due to the current worldwide situation, it has become very difficult to carry out international exchange activities. Many organizations involved in international exchange have been forced to review their activities, and we held our 10th conference online for the first time. Although the format of the forum had changed, we are confident that students and professors were able to deepen their discussions on international issues from different viewpoints and come into contact with diverse values and cultures thanks to the careful preparation and cooperation of all participants. </div>
                <div class="text">On the other hand, it is true that the change in the format of the forum had a great impact on our activities. Due to the time difference and unstable internet environment, the time for discussion and cultural exchange was greatly limited. It is very distressing that it was difficult to deepen exchanges and build trusting relationships, which is one of the major attractions of this forum. We are also preparing for the 11th Forum entirely online, and there is no prospect that we will be able to carry out the same activities as before.</div>
                <div class="text">However, we will put our best effort in finding out what we can do for now and put that into action, rather than lamenting what we cannot do. Our activities are changing as we continue to work online. However, the qualities required to become global leaders will not change. Those qualities are human nature itself, which are  the attitude of understanding and respecting each other on the basis of differences, and the attitude of dealing with problems flexibly in a rapidly changing environment. We will continue our activities with the goal of developing global leaders who possess these qualities in mind. I hope that one day we will be able to achieve our great goal of contributing to the development of future relations between nations through the trust that has been fostered among the students through this conference.</div>
                <div class="text">Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for your support in realizing the activities mentioned above. I look forward to your continued warm guidance and encouragement.</div>

                <div class="text">On behalf of the team, I would like to show our deepest gratitude for your constant support and advice for Global Next Leaders Forum (GNLF). </div>
                <div class="text">This organization has aimed to become a platform from which leaders in the next generation depart and organized nine annual international conferences with students from all over the world. We are currently working on the preparation for the tenth forum, GNLF2021. </div>
                <div class="text">Ten-day-long forum is designed as an opportunity for participating students to acquire knowledge, experience and long-lasting human networks, and develop their personality through the interactions with each other.</div>
                <div class="text">The forum has been held under a different subject every year and has dedicated its program to discussing global problems from various perspectives. The program does not only allow participants to have better judgment on those issues. Further, by revealing the diversity of cultural and social backgrounds among the students, it strikingly awakes in them that their environments having been taken for granted were just one of the various possible sets of values. This insight could be called relativization of oneself. This experience, I believe, from my own experience in the previous conference, can be of great help in nurturing open-minded flexibility and growing up into ideal leaders.</div>
                <div class="text">Spending all day long under the same roof for more than a week also cultivates friendship between the young future leaders from around the globe. The relationships shaped here do not end at the same time as the forum itself, but they last for a long period of time as international bonds. When these bonds contribute to international cooperation and friendship, it would be the time that our largest and most time-consuming purpose will be accomplished. </div>
                <div class="text closing-text">Your kind support is essential in order for our efforts to realize our vision to continue. We would sincerely hope there will be warm and continuous help and encouragement. As president, I am determined to push forward with my colleagues toward handing over the spirit of the forum and producing new values at the same time. Thank you.</div>

                <div class="text">We appreciate the huge support for Global Next Leaders Forum (GNLF).</div>
                <div class="text">We set a goal of raising the next global leaders, who can see and think about things from various perspectives, more than ten years ago. We have held our main forums eight times, and have offered opportunities for representative students from various countries to think about what an essential attitude is in a diverse society. It is imperative to understand and respect each other’s differences and we wish they cherish how they felt during the main forum and continue on to participate in dealing with global issues in the future.</div>
                <div class="text">In our annual main forum, students gather from all over the world to discuss one social theme from their respective backgrounds. Participants may have some knowledge regarding the main topic that is obtained from the media in their daily lives.</div>
                <div class="text">However, there is significant value in what one can obtain from the forum, speaking with and listening to other people. He or she may ‘realize’ something important while taking on the perspective of those who grew up in unfamiliar cultures. What this conference offers is a platform to think based on those ‘realizations’.</div>
                <div class="text">The forum features diverse countries and is distinctive of its method of learning. Countries are selected to participate not based on the power balance of the globe but rather in the perspective of diversity, which makes it possible to have a wide array of diverse perspectives and to avoid  bias towards those from first world countries. Moreover, participants will be staying together for about two weeks, which will enable participants to receive inspiration by others outside of the discussions. The experience will be far more than just sitting and talking together with others from various cultural backgrounds. We provide an opportunity to the participants to truly realize their differences and this is one of the distinctive strengths of our organization that we hope more people will know about.</div>
                <div class="text closing-text">It is always the case with students’ organizations that members get replaced every year. This has disadvantages as well as advantages. Even so, our vision since the launch of this organization has not changed at all. With the spirit in mind of nurturing competent persons, who will flourish worldwide with a global perspective, we will keep on actively organizing our forums with new members. We sincerely hope you will give us further advice and support. Thank you.</div>
